Marc is a student at Mines Paristech, a top French engineering school, and he is expected to complete his master of engineering degree in June 2017. Marc developed a strong interest for statistical analysis applied to cancer research in 2014 during a 6-month internship at Institut Curie, Paris, where he designed a predictive tool for chemotherapy response in breast cancer.

Currently, Marc is working at the Leukemia center and is developing methods for conjointly analyzing RNA sequencing and high-quality whole exome sequencing data for large cohorts of patients.‚Äù
