Sarun Sereewattanawoot recently joined the Papaemmanuil lab as a postdoctoral fellow. He did his PhD studies in computational biology at the University of Tokyo under the mentorship of Prof. Yutaka Suzuki, working on multi-omics and gene network analysis of cell lines and clinical datasets. His undergraduate background was in Medicine from Chulalongkorn University, in Bangkok Thailand where he grew up.

His project at Papaemmanuil lab focuses on using single cell technologies to investigate the relationships between chromosomal alterations and TP53 mutations in transitions of clonal hematopoiesis into hematologic malignancies.
