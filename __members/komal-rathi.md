### Komal Rathi

Komal Rathi is a Bioinformatics Engineer in Elli Papaemmanuil’s lab. She holds a Masters degree in Bioinformatics from the Johns Hopkins University. Prior to MSK, she has experience working at Penn’s Cardiovascular Institute, where her work involved identifying novel lincRNAs and determining their relationship with known transcription factors in Lung development and Human Heart failure.

Her current work in the leukemia genomics group at MSK includes development and implementation of workflows for RNAseq and variant calling as well as refining existing pipelines for copy number variation detection and analysis of high throughput sequencing data.

She is highly motivated by cancer research as it targets one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Her main goal is to develop bioinformatic pipelines and applications in order to improve genomic analysis, automate data processing and provide better visualization methods for scientists.
