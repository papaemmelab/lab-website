Jake Sauter is a master’s student in the Computational Biology program at the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences. He is interested in connecting inter-modality disease screening, progression and treatment insights through the application of data mining and machine learning techniques. Throughout his master’s coursework, Jake has developed an understanding of biological data through the lens of bioinformatics analyses of high throughput experiments.

Prior to joining his master’s program, Jake graduated with a B.S. of Applied Mathematics from State University of New York at Oswego, then worked on developing cutting-edge deep-learning solutions for radio signal classification. He now aims to apply the skills he has developed in computer science, statistics, and machine learning to support better treatment and outcomes for patients.
