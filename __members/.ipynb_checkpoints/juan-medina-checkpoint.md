Juan Medina is a bioinformatics engineer within the leukemia genomics group at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer. He contributes with the execution and automatization of state-of-the-art pipelines used to analyze high throughput sequencing data. This work is conducted in a HPC environment using the Platform Load Sharing Facility (or simply LSF). Additionally, he is currently developing a sample/project management system using the Django framework.

Juan has previously worked at Mayo Clinic, New York University and the Engineering School of Antioquia (Colombia). He has advanced experience in multi-dimensional Digital Signal Proccessing and respiratory physiology (3 scientific publications), Machine Learning and Big Data analisis (SVMs, CNNs, MapReduce), and electronic systems development (received research grant, Colombia).

Juan is an astro-physics enthusiast. He loves NASA’s JPL youtube videos. He also has a MIDI keyboard and spends a lot of time using Ableton Live. His favorite book is “Amor en los tiempos del cólera.”
