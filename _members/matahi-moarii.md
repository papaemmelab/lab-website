Matahi Moarii is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics under the supervision of Elli Papaemmanuil. He is trying to delineate the heterogeneity of Acute Myeloid Leukemia from genetic and phenotypic data using machine learning in order to develop personalized predictive models for diagnosis and targeted therapy. He obtained his PhD at the Center for Computational Biology from the Ecole Mines Paristech under the supervision of Jean-Philippe Vert and Fabien Reyal. He was a fellow from the Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, a French non-profit organization which funds research against cancer in France. During his thesis, he was working on the role of Epigenetics in particular the role of DNA Methylation in gene expression variation using Machine Learning.
